# Invisibility-Cloak
The Invisibility cloak that will make you invisible . 
Interseting , isnt it ?
With the help of opencv this project is done. 
Basically this magic technique is performed using an image processing technique where colour detection and segmentation is performed as  we use a red color cloth as the Invisibile Cloak.
We capture and store the background frame for few seconds them we detect the red coloured cloth using color detection and segmentation .
Then we segment out the red coloured cloth by generatinga mask.
And finally we generate the output on the "sample.mp4" video that we provided.
Note: First turn on your recorder in phone or any other fdevice, then give some time to capture the background then appear with a red colouyr cloth and shoot the video.
Finally put the video where u have saved ur .py file and finally u will witness the magic taking place.
